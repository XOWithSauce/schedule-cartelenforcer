### Realistic Robberies

When a dealer is being robbed, a robber will spawn and engage them in a fight. Your actions affect the regional Cartel influence:

- **Player flees:** If you run out of range, regional influence increases by 20.
- **Successful escape:** If the robber kills the dealer and reaches a safehouse, regional influence increases by 50.

### Intercept Deals

This is a new type of event where the Cartel actively attempts to intercept one of your deals.
- The event can only occur between 16:20 and 04:20 and when the Cartel is hostile.
- Randomized Frequency of Intercept Deals feature is tied to the Activity Frequency config value
- Only deals with less than 5 hours and more than 1 hour and 30 minutes remaining can be intercepted.
- If the player is within 40 units of the customer, the intercept is canceled.
- The Cartel Dealer can have your Stolen Items in their inventory
- **Event Timeline:**
    - When the event starts, the quest icon on the left side of the screen changes to the Benzies logo.
    - A timer of 30 seconds begins before the Cartel dealer starts their intercept.
- **Outcomes:**
    - If you complete the deal within the 30 second grace period, Cartel influence decreases by 50 and your relationship with the customer increases slightly more.
    - If you complete the deal after the grace period but before the Cartel dealer does, Cartel influence decreases by 100 and your relationship with the customer increases slightly more.
    - If the Cartel dealer successfully intercepts the deal, regional influence increases by 100, and your relationship with the customer decreases slightly.

### Drive-By Events

- Only happens at Night Time from 22:30 to 04:00
- Thomas will spawn in a car and try to shoot the player.
- They are triggered when the player is near one of the 11 designated hotspots (common dealing locations, homes, and businesses).

### Mini-Quests

Mini-quests can be obtained from select NPCs (Anna, Fiona, Dean, Mick, Jeff, Dan, Jeremy, Marco or Herbert).
- The quest-giving NPCs are chosen randomly every 4 ingame hours. Random Choice prefers Unlocked NPCs more.
- **Refusal Rate:** The chance an NPC will refuse to give you a quest is now based on your relationship with them. It ranges from a base 20% chance (at worst relations) to a base 50% chance (at best relations).
- **Time Window:** When asking the NPC for rumours during 12:00 to 18:00, the NPC has higher likelihood of giving the __Intercept Cartel Dead Drop__ quest.
- **Payment:** The cost to get a tip is dynamic, ranging from $100 (at best relations) to $500 (at worst relations).
- **Cartel Gathering Effect:** When asking for rumours during time which cartel is gathering, there is higher likelyhood of the NPC Revealing the __active Gathering Location__ instead of giving a quest.

#### Intercept Cartel Dead Drop

- **Dead Drop Location:** Based on the NPC relations there is 60% chance (at best relations) to tell exact location of the dead drop, and 40% chance to tell only the region. At worst relations there is 30% chance to tell the exact location and 70% chance to tell only the region.
- You have a 60 seconds to find the dead drop.
- **Success:** If you find the dead drop in time, you get +100 XP and the regional influence decreases by 25.
- **Failure:** If you fail to find it, the items vanish and regional influence increases by 50.
- **Loot Pools:** One of the following two pools is selected for each quest:
    - **Common (80% chance):** 3-10 items chosen from: Cocaine, Meth, Green Crack Seed, OG Kush Seed.
    - **Rare (20% chance):** 1 item chosen from: Silver Watch, Gold Watch, Silver Chain, Gold Chain, Old Man Jimmy's, Brut du Gloop.
    - **Stolen Items:** Mini-quest rewards now also include some of the items stolen by the Cartel. This is additional to the Loot Pool selected drop.

### Cartel Gatherings

Cartel Gatherings are a regional task that appear frequently and even during the early game, before the cartel becomes hostile. Their locations are picked from all unlocked regions, with new locations unlocking as you progress through the game. 

You can reveal these gathering locations by bribing certain mini quest NPCs.

Gatherings include a "loot goblin" goon carrying stolen items and money if the cartel has stolen from your dealers. 

Goons have varied behaviors, including random animations and voice lines, and they occasionally rotate. 

If player gets nearby they will get annoyed and eventually turn hostile.
If you have killed enough Cartel Dealers, the Gatherings will be hostile on sight at a range depending on the Cartel Dealer Activity value.

- Gathering lasts for 3 hours after which the goons go away
- Killing a gathering will decrease regional cartel influence by 100.
- If a gathering is not defeated, regional influence will increase by 25 (up to a maximum of 400).

---

## End Game Quests

All end game quests scale in difficulty based on the total cartel influence across all regions. Higher total influence will result in enemies having more HP and being overall more lethal and harder to kill. XP Rewards are also scaled based on the total cartel influence to compensate for difficulty.

### Modifying Cartel Dealers
You can customize the Cartel Dealers' settings through the **dealer.json** file.

1. Open the **CartelEnforcer/Dealers** folder inside your **Mods** directory.
2. Open the **dealer.json** file. Its contents by default are:

```json

### Modifying Spawns

You can add or modify custom ambush locations.

1. Open the `Mods/CartelEnforcer/Ambush/ambush.json` file.
2. Edit existing entries or add new ones. Each entry has:
    - **`mapRegion`**: A number from `0-5` for the region.
    - **`ambushPosition`**: The X, Y, and Z coordinates of the trigger area.
    - **`spawnPoints`**: At least four spawn points for enemies (only X and Z values matter).
    - **`detectionRadius`**: A decimal number for how close the player must be to the `ambushPosition`.

```json
    {
      "mapRegion": 5,
      "ambushPosition": {
        "x": 143.05,
        "y": 1.75,
        "z": -16.73
      },
      "spawnPoints": [
        {
          "x": 138.56,
          "y": 0.0,
          "z": -38.61
        },
        {
          "x": 128.19,
          "y": 0.0,
          "z": -9.84
        },
        {
          "x": 135.87,
          "y": 0.0,
          "z": -6.18
        },
        {
          "x": 155.29,
          "y": 0.0,
          "z": -23.90
        }
      ],
      "detectionRadius": 10.0
    },
```

#### Modifying Default Spawns

1. Open `Mods/CartelEnforcer/Ambush/default.json`.
2. You can only **modify** the values here; do not add or remove any ambushes.
3. If the game receives a new update, delete `default.json` to ensure your configuration is up to date. It will be recreated the next time you load a save.

---

#### Modifying Cartel Stolen Items

1. Open `Mods/CartelEnforcer/CartelItems/(organisation name).json`.
2. You can modify the values here and change quantity of items as you wish or add new ones. Make sure the item ID is always a valid id. You can also change cartel stolen balance.
3. If you want to reset the stolen items in the specific save, you can delete the file and it will get regenerated.

---

### Debug Mode

In debug mode, you can see various visual cues and use keybinds to test features.

> The Debug Mode does not log anything into console in version 1.4.0 and above for performance reasons. For Console Logs you need to build the dll file from source code using DEBUG configuration. See [GitHub BUILD.md](https://github.com/XOWithSauce/schedule-cartelenforcer/blob/main/.github/BUILD.md) for more info.

- **Cubes**: Visualize ambush positions. Their size corresponds to the detection radius and their color is based on the region. Standing under a cube will eventually trigger an ambush.
- **Cyan Beams**: Visualize the four spawn points for each cube.
- **Orange Spheres**: Show the locations of drive-by events triggers. Standing under the Sphere will eventually trigger a Drive-By.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xEt43yQ.png">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7x5l97m.png">

- **Keybinds:**
    - `Left CTRL + R`: Trigger a Dealer Robbery at the nearest dealer.
    - `Left CTRL + G`: Trigger an instant drive-by at the nearest location.
    - `Left CTRL + H`: Give a mini-quest to one of the select NPCs.
    - `Left CTRL + L`: Log internal mod data to the console. ( Only Debug Builds )
    - `Left CTRL + T`: Trigger an Intercept Deal event.
    - `Left CTRL + Y`: Generate the Unexpected Alliances Quest dialogue option for Manny, without checking prerequirements.
    - `Left CTRL + U`: Generate the Infiltrate Manor Quest dialogue option for Manny, without checking prerequirements.
    - `Left CTRL + P`: Instantly spawn a Cartel Gathering at a random location

---

### In Multiplayer

For multiplayer to function correctly, all players must have the same `default.json`, `ambush.json` and `config.json` content.

Not all events and activities added by this mod support multiplayer fully and might have bugs on server clients.

---
> **Note:** The `config.json`, `default.json` and persistent cartel stolen items files will be created automatically in the `Mods/CartelEnforcer/` directory if they are missing.
