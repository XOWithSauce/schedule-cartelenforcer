# Version 1.5.6
- Simplified the way which Cartel Dealers get assigned with players pending deals to reduce lag.
- Fixed a bug where the Cartel Dealers would get assigned contracts even after bedtime when they are supposed to head back inside
- Fixed a bug where the Cartel Dealers would not update their activity status while cartel is other than hostile
- Fixed a bug where the Cartel Dealers would not trigger Safety if activity is low enough and safety is enabled, when cartel is other than hostile
- Fixed a bug where after stay inside ends or the deal signal ends, the cartel dealer could inproperly fail contracts when not intended
- Fixed a bug where the code would try to make dead or knocked out cartel dealers walk to locations in their free time
- Fixed a bug where the code would try to make cartel dealers walk to locations outside of their dynamic time range
- Fixed a potential bug in loading the cartel stolen items
- Fixed a bug in the Cartel Dealer config where DealerActivityIncreasePerDay value was incorrectly set to the DealerActivityDecreasePerKill value
- Fixed a bug in the Cartel Dealer config where the StealDealerContractChance value was incorrectly set to the StealPlayerContractChance value
- Added some coroutine safety checks to prevent mod from throwing errors in various scenarios when exiting to menu or reloading save

# Version 1.5.5
- Changed the way which intercept deals event evaluates active player contracts. The new method skips parsing ui elements totally which was a dumb but working method previously. Should have less lag now.
- Added new calculation logic for intercept deals event where it now should dynamically evaluate both the random contract and cartel dealer who intercepts. This change should make more contracts succesfully accepted for the intercept deals event and targets potentially nearby cartel dealers for that event.
- Changed the Intercept Deals event to now correctly pertain their contract even after cartel dealer is killed. This change also allowed the original XP to be assigned back to the existing contract. Additionally the event now awards correct amount of XP when completed by player and only 1 xp when completed by cartel dealer. Previously it was 50% of original XP regardless of who completes.
- Lowered the NPC Relationship Status change in Intercept Deals Event down from 0.25 to 0.10 based on who completed contract. (0.00 - 5.00 range)
- Changed Cartel Dealers Walking behaviour to only target locations, within their respective regions. This should fix a bug where intercept dealer would walk from across the map and constantly fail intercept deals due to walking for 2 ingame hours.
- Lowered the default chance values for Cartel Dealers taking Players hired dealers active deals and also players pending offers, down from 20% and 20% to 3% and 3%. This was overlooked because the evaluation runs every ingame hour and each cartel dealer has sequential chance to first take 20% chance for dealer contract, then another 20% if the previous failed, and because this gets calculated for 5 dealers, the overall chance for any given contract to be taken is extremely high every ingame hour. Higher values prevent Intercept Deals from happening due to Cartel Dealers being reserved for these.
- Adjusted the Gatherings Frequency to be less common overall by roughly 1 ingame hour across any given dealer activity status (how many killed)
- Increased the Cartel Influence change from defeating a gathering up from 50 to 100
- Fixed a bug in the Cartel Gatherings when player has negative Cartel Dealer activity status, the Gathering goons would not attack player properly
- Fixed a bug in the function controlling Dealer Activity timings based on Cartel Dealer killings. Bug caused killing dealers to not decrease their activity as it should have.
- Set the Cartel Dealer Aggression to be at 1f instead of whatever it is at default. Cartel Dealers occasionally ran away when shot at, and because of movement speed multiplier they are running faster than what was intended this should make them attack back more / always.
- Fixed some bugs related to default cartel dealer behaviours and intercept deal event being conflicting. This should allow consistently the dealer to have intercept event deals even beyond 04:00 default maximum stay inside time limit.
- Fixed a bug in Manor end game quest where Ray would not properly reset their schedule after quest was failed
- For some reason Versioning number has been forgotten to change since 1.5.1 inside the Melon Loader entry, now that is up to date and should show 1.5.5 every time mod loads

# Version 1.5.4
- Changed the cartel dealers behaviour so that they can roam the map while cartel is in status unknown, friendly or defeated in addition to being hostile, this wont trigger the dealers stealing your or your dealers contracts before cartel turns hostile
- Changed the code default generated values for the dealer.json config to be the same as in documentation since they were different

- Cartel Gathering has always 1 loot goblin goon, who has Cartel Stolen Items in their inventory, if cartel has stolen items from your dealers
- Cartel Gathering goons always have their inventories filled with $500 of stolen money if cartel has stolen money from your dealers
- Changed the Cartel Dealer processing in Handovers, to override the completed deal payment to 0, this fixes the bug where in early game the dealers will do lots of contracts and display their rewards to player
- Added more Mini Quest giving NPCs: Dan, Jeremy, Marco, Herbert
- Changed mini quest generation to only work during 07:00 to 24:00
- Lowered the chance of Mini Quest being givven to player by any given npc, but alternatively if the random roll is not met the NPC will give out Gathering location if one is active
- Added worldspace text templates where npc tells the location to player
- Added support for saving the stolen quantity of cash in each save in the cartel stolen items json file
- Removed redundant keybind inputs for safe placement and goon array extend from Debug mode

# Version 1.5.1
- Added new Manor End game quest
- Fixed cartel dealers standing still in their apartment doors, now they will try to travel to random locations and should consistently deal
- Changed cartel dealers start time to be randomized between 16:20 and 16:59
- Fixed an issue where cartel dealer would not automatically take contracts pending for player 
- Fixed an isse where cartel dealer would not automatically take contracts active for player dealers
- Fixed a critical issue where players unlocked customers could get removed from the static Customer instance unlocked customers
- Fixed a logic issue with end game quests where the dialogue index was not saved so there was a possibility to accidentally remove incorrect dialogue option
- Fixed a critical issue where rarely in IL2CPP the End Game Quest entries would not get correctly mapped or the entry original objects get garbage collected, then the pointer to that quest entry object during the quest is a random pointer to the games memory and this caused multiple types of errors where Quest proceeding will cause the game to start casting random memory locations to IEnumerable
- Reverted the change in v1.5.0 where dealers get robbed inside building, back to dealers not getting robbed inside buildings due to community feedback

# Version 1.5.0
- Added a new end game mission that can be acquired from Manny (a.k.a. Fixer in Warehouse)
- Added new Configuration values cartelDealChance and endGameQuest
- Added new functionality to the mod where Cartel Dealers will now go out of their homes to deal more, based on the cartel deal chance and activity frequency. This is additional to the normal customer dealings they have. This functionality will be ran alongside the interceptDeals configuration value since its behaviour is similiar.
- Added new functionality to the mod to override Cartel Dealer behaviour and daily events timeline. They now leave their homes at earliest 16:20 and will stop dealing at 4:20.
- Intercept event base frequency raised to 120 up from 90, now intercepts will happen a bit less at default activity frequency. Intercept event Lowest frequency was lowered to 240 from 480. Now at activity frequency -1.0 intercepts will happen more.
- Changed Mini Quests feature to be better chance at 12:00 - 18:00 to give quests by the NPC (business hours rumours)
- Changed the logic of Players hired Dealers getting robbed, back to allowing Dealers getting robbed if they are inside building but outside the range where the real robberies event can run, this will inadvertedly increase the amount of player hired dealers getting robbed.
- Fixed the Mini Quests dialogue incorrectly displaying 2 prepositions in the phrase
- Tried to fix intercept event throwing errors if player invalidates contract by completing it early into the feature

# Versions 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 for IL2CPP
- Fixed bug that caused robbery to always throw errors when doing message robbery
- Fixed bug that caused saving cartel stolen items to throw errors

# Version 1.4.0
- Code base change now divided to files and conditional statements instead of having over 3k lines in 1 file for 2 different builds
- Performance boost from object state management and codebase proof reading and fixing
- Fixed a bug where the Dealer would start targetting itself in combat, resulting in them spinning around and trying to hit themselves. This happened only in robberies and they lost every fight.
- Changed the Drive By Shooting speed to be static at 4 bullets per second, but can be slower because of randomization
- Fixed a bug in the IL2Cpp version where the saved items serializer would still not work, again due to coding mistake missing serializer attribute on the class
- Changed Mini Quest duration to be static 60 seconds instead of random from 60-120
- Changed Intercept Deals feature grace time before Cartel Dealer starts walking, from random 10-30 seconds to static 30 seconds
- Removed Debug key to log the inventory contents as it was only used for testing
- Changed mini quest to only generate when cartel is hostile, previously it generated in other states too but the dialogue option was locked
- Changed the Release version of the mod to not contain debug logs anymore, meaning that Debug Mode will not Log anything anymore. This reduces filesize by over 50kb and should offer a performance boost. Logging can be enabled by building from source code in GitHub with Debug configuration enabled.
- Robbery feature now rolls random chance to give robber different weapons: 50% chance to be only fists, 45% chance to be a knife, 5% chance to be a pump shotgun
- Fixed Robbery feature message robberies targetting dead or inside building dealers, which was unrealistic behaviour
- Alot of other miscellanious undocumented changes that have happened but forgot to write down, these are mainly for performance boosts and other il2cpp related bugs.





# Version 1.3.2
- Changed the Mini Quest system to prefer Unlocked NPCs. If the NPC is Locked, there is only 30% chance to generate the miniquest. Otherwise the random selection and generation will be 100% chance if locked. The Dialogue still has its own randomisation allowing the NPC to decline giving quest.
- Changed the Drive By shooting speed to slower, from max 10 bullets / second and min 5 bullets / second -> down to max 4 bullets/second and min 2 bullets / second
    - Drive By event and Death was nearly unavoidable at some locations when triggered, and the shooting logic worked too well and sprayed 5 bullets a second consistently at nearby range... Dying over and over again to same drive by location is not intended behaviour.
- Fixed a bug in where the Stolen Items Persistent system would not find the correct item while trying to save it
- Fixed a bug in IL2Cpp version where the Stolen Items persistent system would cause errors while loading or saving items
- Fixed a bug in IL2Cpp version where the activity frequency system would fail to cast instances, not causing errors but indexing different activities incorrectly

- Fixed dealer robbing to target only unlocked and recruited dealers (previously locked region dealers got robbed)
- Fixed dealer robbing targetting sometimes dead or knocked out or inside building dealers

- Fixed a coding mistake in the persistent stolen items system where instead of evaluating Packaging ID, it was evaluating Item ID, causing the calculation for Stolen Quantity to be incorrect
- Fixed a bug where the Intercept Deals in the First Game region would cause errors, because there is no designated cartel dealer for the region
- Fixed a bug where after Drive By Event Thomas would keep floating in the air where the Car despawned at

# Version 1.3.0
- Added 4 new configuration values to allow individual frequency change of Ambush, Dead Drop Steal, Cartel Customer Deal and Cartel Robbery events frequencies
    - Default at 1.0 means that the event frequency is NOT capped at all and can happen every ingame hour (doesnt mean that it will happen every hour)
    - at 0.0 the event can happen only once every 2 ingame days at fastest
    - at -1.0 the event can happen only once every 4 ingame days at fastest
    - Note: These values dont change how often something happens, these values decide when something CAN happen next time (as opposed to activityFrequency which directly changes frequency of when something happens)
- Added new configuration value for Intercept Deals
    - New type of event where Cartel will Actively attempt to intercept Player deals
    - Based on activityFrequency deal CAN be intercepted at 1.0 every ingame hour and at -1.0 every 8 ingame hours and At 0.0 every 3 ingame hours.
    - Deals can Only be intercepted from 6pm to 4am only and Cartel must be Hostile
    - Only Deals with less than 5 hours left AND more than 1 hour and 30mins left can be intercepted by cartel
    - If player is closer than 40 units distance to the Customer whose deal is about to be intercepted, the intercept is cancelled.

- Adjusted Robber Adrenaline boost to have faster movement speed and adjust more smoothly
- Changed Mini Quests to now ask for a dynamic payment price, based on the relations status with the NPC. If at best possible relations, the Mini Quest costs 100 cash. If at lowest possible relations it will cost 500 cash. Previously it was static 100 cash.
- Changed Mini Quest Refusal rate to be much lower and based on the relations with the NPC. At best possible relations there is only 40% chance to refuse to give the quest. At worst possible relations there is 70% chance to refuse.
- Changed Mini Quest to have the NPC tell player more often the exact location, based on the NPC Relation data, at best relation there is only 40% chance to tell the region and 60% chance to tell the exact location of the Cartel Dead Drop
- Changed Mini Quest Lower timerange to be 60 instead of 30 seconds to allow player to reach across the map
- Changed Mini Quest Rewards to Additionally give out some of the Cartel Stolen Items

- Fixed a bug where Dealer combat behaviour would not stop after defeating the robber
- Fixed a bug where the Robber would not travel to the correct building, but nearest door

- Added a new feature to enhance the Dealer Robbing Mechanism in the base game
    - When player is within 60 units of a Dealer, that is about to get Robbed the feature gets triggered
    - Dealer will send a Text Message to the Player indicating they are getting robbed and asking for help
    - A Robber is spawned near the Dealer and they begin to fight
        - If the Robber dies or gets knocked out during fight the feature ends and nothing is stolen. 
        - If the Player runs away more than 90 units from the Robber, the Dealer will always succesfully defend the robbery.
